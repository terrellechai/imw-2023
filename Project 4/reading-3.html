          <h2>Reading: 3</h2>
          <p>
            Laurel highlights the subtle manipulative nature of social media
            platforms, revealing that beneath their seemingly accommodating
            fa√ßade lies a prioritization of advertising and sales over user
            satisfaction. Consequently, users often experience more anxiety than
            fulfillment while engaging with these platforms. She contends that
            personal websites offer a solution to this dilemma by providing a
            space for authentic self-expression, free from corporate influence.
            Unlike company-owned platforms, personal websites can be tailored to
            individual preferences and needs. Laurel advocates for a shift
            towards individual-run websites to restore authenticity to the web
            and prioritize user satisfaction over corporate interests.
            <br /><br />
            While I acknowledge Laurel's perspective and agree with her in
            principle, I find her proposed solution somewhat impractical, at
            least for the present moment. The concept of unlimited creative
            expression is appealing, but the reality of website creation and
            maintenance presents a significant barrier for many users. Social
            media platforms offer a more accessible option for those unfamiliar
            with web development or uninterested in managing their own website.

            <br /><br />
            A website functions like a digital storefront on the vast internet
            highway, drawing in online visitors to explore its information and
            offerings. Its homepage acts as a prominent signboard, instantly
            grabbing attention with eye-catching visuals and concise details,
            conveying its message at a glance. Similar to a well-designed
            billboard, a website's layout and design swiftly communicate the
            essence of its content. The navigation bar acts as a guide,
            directing visitors to various sections with ease. Much like a
            billboard, a website's effectiveness lies in its ability to leave a
            lasting impression and convey its main message clearly amidst the
            fast-paced online traffic.
