    <h1>Creative Process</h1>
    <p>
      <!-- Explanation of the creative process -->
      The creative process for this project began with the utilization of Figma,
      a versatile digital design tool. My inspiration for this interactive web
      project stemmed from the upcoming Lunar New Year celebration, particularly
      focusing on the color red, symbolizing good luck and joy in Asian culture.
      Reflecting on Vietnamese culture and considering that 2023 is the Year of
      the Cat, I decided to incorporate a feline character, Luna, into the
      narrative. This choice guided the color palette and theme of the project.

      <!-- Explanation of the transition from a gym theme to a Luna theme -->
      When starting this project the first idea I had was to make the narrative
      about an experience going to the gym in the night. I had the idea of
      having the first page as a night scene, with a small building made out of
      css at the bottom right. Second page would have a bar slider, which would
      represent the user swiping their card to get into the gym. Moreover I soon
      realized that this idea would be a lot to do in the short period of time I
      have. So I came up with the idea to make a project called "Feed Luna".
      Essentially a cat that is hungry and needs to eat. I designed a plate
      where the food will go on. Theres 3 types, Cat food, Fish and Poison. I
      tried to turn this narrative into a game as best as possible. Once Luna is
      fed, her eyes turn into a heart. When Luna eats the poison she turns green
      with her eyes turning black.

      <!-- Summary of the creative process and theme -->

      In conclusion, the creative journey for this project commenced with the
      versatile digital design tool, Figma. Inspired by the approaching Lunar
      New Year and the cultural significance of the color red, which embodies
      good luck and joy in Asian culture, the project's thematic direction was
      set. Delving into Vietnamese culture and acknowledging the Year of the Cat
      in 2023, I chose to weave a narrative around a feline character named
      Luna. This decision not only influenced the color palette but also guided
      the overall theme of the interactive web project.
